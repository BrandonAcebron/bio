	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(1)</sup>Hi, my name is Mach Brandon A. Acebron, I was born on February 26, 2000 in a provincial hospital in my hometown, the Northern Samar Provincial Hospital.<sup>(2)</sup> I am the youngest in my family, brought to this world by Estela A. Cui and Joel Acebron, which are my parents. <sup>(3)</sup>I was raised in a small, yet beautiful town, which is “Laoang”.<sup>(4)</sup> The people, food, place, environment there is great that you won’t ask for anything more.<sup>(5)</sup> I have lived a simple childhood era, which was before the technology took over.<sup>(6)</sup> And I’m glad and thankful with that.<sup>(7)</sup>  I was the best “pogpak” player in my neighborhood, kids from different will go to our barangay just to play and will try to defeat me, but guess what? They always go home empty-handed.<sup>(8)</sup> I studied and graduated my daycare schooling  just near our home, I will not forget it because it was the first time I danced (chicken dance and folk dance).<sup>(9)</sup> The early elementary years were my best time of my life, playing under the blazing sun, doesn’t care even if my skin color will be like a charcoal.<sup>(10)</sup> Waking up early just to play pogpak with my neighbors.<sup>(11)</sup>  After that, we will spend our time under the trees playing non-sense games just to waste our time.<sup>(12)</sup>  I also experienced the forced siesta, and that will be the ticket to go outside in the afternoon.<sup>(13)</sup> In the afternoon, most of the kids in the neighborhood will gather in front of our street to talk about the games we will play. Patintero, Tumbang Preso, Doktor Kwak-kwak, “Bang-sak”,”Bar atching-ul”, etc. are the games we like to play. <sup>(14)</sup> I was 5 years old when I discovered that I am good in mental math. <sup>(15)</sup> My relatives will always organize a competition to me and my cousins for who will answer fast and correct. <sup>(16)</sup>Not to brag but I am always the winner even if I am the youngest among  my cousins. <sup>(17)</sup> That talent brought me to be a contender of my school in Samar competitions. <sup>(18)</sup> I was always the candidate for “Math Olympiad”, “MTAP”, “Damath” and “Sci-Damath”. It was a fun experience because the company I am with are my friends. <sup>(19)</sup> The only part of competing that I don’t like is the travelling. <sup>(20)</sup>I am weak when it comes to air-conditioned vehicles, but it was back then.<sup>(21)</sup> Now, I have overcome it.</dd>

<sup>(1)</sup> I was 12 years old when I was a freshman.<sup>(2)</sup> My planned school to be enrolled was not followed because I was in Manila in the time of entrance exam. <sup>(3)</sup> So I enrolled to my 2nd choice, which is the LNTHS. <sup>(4)</sup> I was sad at first because of things not working out for me. <sup>(5)</sup> I was jealous because my elementary were in laboratory(dream school). <sup>(6)</sup> But after a month, I moved on and just enjoyed my high school life. <sup>(7)</sup> High school years was different from elementary years. <sup>(8)</sup> And I was “culture shocked” by that. <sup>(9)</sup> Era of hitting puberty, having a relationship, curiosity begins to move in my mind. <sup>(10)</sup> I was in 2nd year when I had my first relationship. <sup>(11)</sup> And it was with the valedictorian of our school. <sup>(12)</sup> It was also the year where I discovered DOTA, and got addicted to that beautiful game. <sup>(13)</sup> Met with strangers  who loved the game. <sup>(14)</sup> It was the one helped have new friends because I’m not so good with making  new friends. <sup>(15)</sup> Me and my longtime best friends will occasionally skip class just to play that game with college students. <sup>(16)</sup>It is where I found genuine people despite different ages. <sup>(17)</sup> Bonding midnight in the plaza after playing. <sup>(18)</sup> I will not forget it because it was the best time of high school years. <sup>(19)</sup> Because, in my school, I usually cannot get along with my school friends because we have different interests. <sup>(20)</sup> Eventually, at the last year of my high school, I had a realization that it’s not good playing DOTA anymore, it will ruin my grades. <sup>(21)</sup> So I made a new goal and refocused on my academics.</dd>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>(1)</sup>  My college years is a bit of a roller coaster ride. <sup>(2)</sup> After graduating senior high school, I just had a little vacation because of need to take a summer class in Accountancy. <sup>(3)</sup> I passed the entrance exam but failed in the qualifying exam. <sup>(4)</sup> I got a mental breakdown after that, I didn’t know what to do because  I desired of it since I was in elementary. <sup>(5)</sup> I called my oldest sister( the one that’s paying for my tuition) to say that I will enroll in other BSBA program just to not stop school because it will be a waste of time if I stopped.<sup>(6)</sup> I enrolled in BSBA-Management, where I met my college friends who are until still my friends. <sup>(7)</sup> College life is different from high school or elementary. <sup>(8)</sup> People are already matured, open minded, so it’s easy to get along with strangers. <sup>(9)</sup> It was a sad feeling for me because I only enrolled there for 1 academic year, because of course, that was not the course that I like. <sup>(10)</sup> But, that 1 year was worth the memory,  I explored many things in life. <sup>(11)</sup> First time drinking, first time on the beach at night, all the first time a freshman would do. <sup>(1)</sup> After 1 school year, I stopped because I couldn’t get an entrance exam in UE. In that 1 year hiatus, what I did was apply in a bar for 3months. <sup>(12)</sup> After that, I moved to a new job, which is being a server in a catering service. <sup>(13)</sup> After how many months of waiting for the month of entrance exam, I eventually moved here in Manila. <sup>(14)</sup> It was the start of pandemic so It was not promising. <sup>(15)</sup> Got stuck in a condo for 10 months doing nothing but surfing the internet all the time. <sup>(16)</sup> It was August when the  first online class began, and I find it very uncomfortable because I was not used in that kind of setup. <sup>(17)</sup> After 3 years, the teaching setup was changed, it was now an blended learning, so I can now experience the true college life in a city that I was  expecting. <sup>(18)</sup> Met my city buddies, bonded with them in school. <sup>(19)</sup> I am still in college so I am hoping for an adventurous era of my life. <sup>(20)</sup> Hoping to be successful in the future.</dd>
